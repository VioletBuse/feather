# feather

[![Hex Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/hex-docs-ffaff3)](https://hexdocs.pm/feather/)

```sh
gleam add feather
```
Add the following fields to your gleam.toml file:

```toml
# this can of course be anything you like
migrations_dir = "./priv/migrations"
schemafile = "./schema.sql"
```

Then run the command `gleam run -m feather -- new "Initial schema migration"` and make any changes you like.

Running the command `gleam run -m feather -- schema` will create the file ./schema.sql, (or whatever you set in your gleam.toml) with the schema of your database after all migrations have been applied.

```gleam
import feather
import gleam/result
import gleam/erlang
import sqlight

pub fn main() {
  let assert Ok(priv_dir) = erlang.priv_directory("my_module_name")
  use migrations <- result.try(feather.get_migrations(priv_dir <> "/migrations"))
  use connection <- feather.connect(feather.Config(..feather.default_config(), file: "./database.db"))
  feather.migrate(migrations, on: connection)
}
```
